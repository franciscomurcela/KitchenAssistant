<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The population in many countries, including Portugal, is ageing. Also, there is a decrease of human resources in healthcare. It is essential to invest in prevention, creating conditions for older adults to stay longer in their homes and remain active, but at the same time provide some assistance in their daily life tasks. This assistance has the potential to help elderly people maintain a dignified life at home, in their space, with more autonomy, and increased safety. To serve as a proof-of-concept for this new paradigm, University of Aveiro, in partnership with OLI company, Rovisco Pais Rehabilitation Center, and several companies associated with INOVADOMUS, is exploring novel solutions for an older adult smart home. A key part of this project is the construction of a real home (with the main infrastructure already in place).</p>
